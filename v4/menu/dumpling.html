    Our meat rice dumpling has been popular ever since its launch. It has  been our top seller for many years as its rich flavour is very unique  and loved by all. Essentially a Nanyang Cantonese style dumpling, its  ingredients include dried scallops, Korean dried oyster, fresh cashew  nuts, golden salted egg, 3 layer pork belly meat, fragrant mushroom and  100% Thai fragrant glutinous rice. It&rsquo;s a heady mix that cannot be found  anywhere else. </td>
